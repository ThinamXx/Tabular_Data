# **Tabular Data**
- In this repository, I have included the Notebooks which primarily focuses on Tabular Data Implementation. The Notebooks included are:

[**Austin Animal Center**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Tabular_Data..AustinAnimalCenter/blob/master/Austin%20Animal%20Center/Austin%20Animal%20Center.ipynb)
  - In this Notebook, I have prepared the classifier using KNeighbors Classifier along with various Exploratory Data Analysis techniques such as Data preprocessing, Features Engineering, Data Visualization along with Data Imputation. You can gain insights about KNeighbors Classifier, EDA and many more.

[**Exploratory Data Analysis**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Tabular_Data..AustinAnimalCenter/blob/master/Austin%20Animal%20Center/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
  - In this Notebook, I have used various EDA such as Features Preprocessing, Data Visualization and Imputation as well. You can gain insights about various Exploratory Data Analysis steps and understanding from detail. I have carried out EDA in Austin Animal Center Dataset.

[**Implementation of KNeighbors Classifier**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Tabular_Data..AustinAnimalCenter/blob/master/KNeighbors%20Classifier.ipynb)
  - In this Notebook, you can get insights about the Implementation of KNeighbors Classifier in detail.

### **KNearest Neighbors**
- In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm is a non-parametric method proposed by Thomas Cover used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space.
